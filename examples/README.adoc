== Architecture Tests

The use-case this example intends to demonstrate is as follows:

You have two modules:

* my-module
* my-other-module

Both of these modules must contain only classes that reside under your domain, for example this one is dev.mrbergin.

You write ArchUnit tests to enforce this, but don't want to repeat yourself across both modules, so you refactor it out to an arch-tests module.

Using the run-dependency-tests plugin you can now configure the `test` task for my-module and my-other-module with the arch-tests module.
